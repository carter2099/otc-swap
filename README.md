# otc-swap
Trustless peer to peer swap of digital assets

Won't finish. The happy path of swapping ETH using the otc swap flow defined in 
contracts/OtcSwap.sol works as demonstrated in scripts/deploy.ts. 

Run `npx hardhat run deploy.ts`
to see the ETH otc swap in action. 

It was fun to get a smart contract working but optimizing for gas seems hard
